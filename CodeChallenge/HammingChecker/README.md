# Error Detection - The Hamming Checker

The Hamming Code method is a network technique designed by R.W.Hamming, for damage and error detection during data transmission between multiple network channels.

The Hamming Code method is one of the most effective ways to detect single-data bit errors in the original data at the receiver end. It is not only used for error detection but is also for correcting errors in the data bit.

Steps to follow for error detection using the Hamming Checker Code:
    1. Enter the Data to be transmitted
    2. Calculate the no of redundant bits required
    3. Determine the parity bits
    4. Create error data for testing
    5. Check for errors


### Script Execution Instructions

You can run the hamming.py script using the terminal or command line. This works on all platforms (Mac OS, Windows, Linux)

To open a terminal on Windows: press the windows key + r key (run program), type cmd or command and press enter.

On Mac OS use finder to start a terminal. You can hit command+space and type terminal, then hit enter.

To run the hamming.py script, you have to open the command line or terminal and type:

``` python hamming.py ```

For this to work you need to be in the correct directory. That means, the directory where your humming.py script is located.


### Running Tests Instructions

You can run the tests.py script using the terminal or command line. This works on all platforms (Mac OS, Windows, Linux)

To open a terminal on Windows: press the windows key + r key (run program), type cmd or command and press enter.

On Mac OS use finder to start a terminal. You can hit command+space and type terminal, then hit enter.

To run the tests.py script, you have to open the command line or terminal and type:

``` python tests.py ```

For this to work you need to be in the correct directory. That means, the directory where your tests.py script is located.

The **worst case space complexity** of the Hamming Checker is very minimum because the amount of memory allocated to the algorithm is less proportional to the amount of memory available on the host machine.
