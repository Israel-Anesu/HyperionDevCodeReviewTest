Line 1 - When naming class names or any identifier be it a variable, method, function, constant, module or package in python, the name of the identifier should be descriptive 
in order to write readable code and also following good practices on how to write Python code. You can visit the following link for further reference: https://realpython.com/python-pep8/

Line 2 - On this line of code you were supposed to use tab spacing which is equivalent to 4 spaces after the class definition so as to indicate that the code is within the class
and this is important because Python uses identation to separate blocks of code, this can be seen in other programming languages like JavaScript and C# by the use of curly braces 
to separate blocks of code. You can visit the following link for further reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/indentation-in-python/

Line 3 - Here an identationError was raised similar to line 2 because the definition of the empty dictionary was supposed to be within or inside the groupAnagrams() function indicating that the
dictionary will be used within the function.

Line 4 - Another identationError was raised here because the loop or iteration statement was supposed to be within the groupAnagrams() function similar to line 3, which means the empty dictionary and the loop should be on the same identation level and at the same time being idented within the groupAnagrams().

The implementation or logic of the solution is very good and I'm impressed with that, now what you are supposed to know is code identation and Python programming conversions and 
practices so as to write readable code.

Your final solution was supposed to be like the following code:

```
class Solution:
   def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
      result = {}
      for i in strs:
         x = "".join(sorted(i))
         if x in result:
            result[x].append(i)
         else:
            result[x] = [i]
      return list(result.values())
ob1 = Solution()
print(ob1.groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]))

```
